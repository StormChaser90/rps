// name constant called scissors, wins against papers, loses against rock.

// // create a variable named items, containing rock, paper, and scissors.
// let items = {["rock", "paper", "scissors"]}
// // return random of items; rock, paper, or scissors

// // create a function that plays 1 round of RPS, this function takes two parameters, playerSelection and computerSelection.
// function playRound(playerSelection, computerSelection);
// using the variables generated from random, compare playerSelection against computerSelection 

// return a string declaring the winner of round.

// make function case insensitive

// important note; you want to return the results of this function call, not console.log() them. To test this function console.log the results (check odin page for reference).

// write a new function called game

// use previous function INSIDE this one to play a 5 round game that keeps score and reports winner or loser at end.
